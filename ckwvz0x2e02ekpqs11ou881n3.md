## How I setup my Website for free with Cloudflare pages

# Hello üëã, 
Today we will learn how to set up your website on the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è for free!
First, I will introduce to you [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) and how we can use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) to deploy a website for free.

## What is [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/)?
According to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/):
> [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) is one of the most extensive networks operating on the Internet. People use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) services to increase the security and performance of their websites and services.

tl;dr they are a [CDN provider](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/cdn/), [DDoS Migration provider](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/ddos/), and many more. Anything you need to make your website more secure and faster.


### [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) Pages üìÑ
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) recently introduced a service called [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.dev/), which is what this guide will guide you on how to use it to its fullest potential!

Now [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.dev/) are not a new concept. For example, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Verel](https://vercel.com/), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) & [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/).
Why did I pick [Cloudflare](https://pages.dev/) instead of all those things I mentioned above?

Well, the answer is simple. They have the advantages that other providers don't have; simply because they have over [200+ data centers worldwide](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/network/), no matter where your potential viewers are, they will be guaranteed to load your website fast üí®!

**plus, they have a free tier, which is fantastic üëè**

## Setting up [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.dev/)!
Now, this is the fun part. here's how you set up [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.dev/) and make your website from üêå to üî•

### Setup [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) account üîë

First, you need to make a [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) account, head over to [https://pages.cloudflare.com/](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and click on [Sign Up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/pages)

Once you sign up, you can add your domain to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) via the add site button.

Select the free tier; then, it will scan your current DNS settings and migrate them to Cloudflare; after that, click continue.

</details>

Once you've clicked that button, it should prompt you to connect to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account; you want to do that, then authorize it to either your main [GitHub](https://github.com/) account or your organization [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
After you've linked your [GitHub](https://github.com/), you can click the repository you want to host, then click begin setup! 

#### Extra settings

Next, you can set your project name, the branch you want to use, and your build settings.

If you want to host a static HTML file, you can set the framework preset to none, then put the build command as `exit 0.`

*it may take 2 - 5 min for it to build your site depending on the site*
